  description: [
    The matrix multiplication accelerator is designed as a Memory-Mapped I/O
    (MMIO) device with an AXI slave interface, incorporating control,
    status, and data input/output registers. The core of this accelerator is
    a systolic array, which is configurable from sizes ranging between 4x4
    and 256x256, providing scalability based on the application
    requirements.

    This accelerator facilitates the acceleration of matrix multiplication
    operations, a fundamental computational task in many high-performance
    applications such as deep learning and scientific computing. The
    systolic array architecture is specifically chosen for its efficiency in
    handling large-scale matrix operations, as it allows for high throughput
    and low-latency computation by leveraging the parallel processing
    capabilities inherent in the systolic design.

    The operation of the accelerator is managed via control registers, where
    users can configure the systolic arrayâ€™s mode, initiate operations, and
    control data flow. Input data is fed into the systolic array through the
    data input registers, and the results are retrieved via the data output
    registers. Status registers provide real-time feedback on the progress
    and completion of operations, enabling efficient monitoring and
    management of the computation process.

    By offloading matrix multiplication tasks to this accelerator, the
    computational burden on the main processor is significantly reduced,
    allowing it to focus on other tasks, thereby improving the overall
    system performance. This MMIO-based design also simplifies the
    integration of the accelerator into existing systems, ensuring
    compatibility and ease of use.
